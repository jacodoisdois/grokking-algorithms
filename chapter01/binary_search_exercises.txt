1 - Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?
    Binary search bad cases is resolved in Log n. "N" in this case is 128, the equivalent of log2 128 is 2^7, so the number of the steps is 7.

2 - Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?
    The maximum number of steps is 8 because it's the same of 2^7 + 2^1.
